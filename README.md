# Mobile-Applications-Development-2-Project
# Brick Breaker 2020
## Game Abouts
The project is a 2-Dimensional mobile game, I decided that a simple Action game like shooting and breaking game would be suitable because of the limited spaces and controls users have on their devices. It is a hybrid shooting platform game as ball will move in both directions but the paddle will move only left and right.
## Game Play
1. press Arrow keys to meve the paddle right or left.
2. press space button to shoot the ball from paddle.
3. break the bricks to get points each brick worh 1 point.
4. some bricks need double hits to break.
5. player gets 3 lives initially but randomly hearts spawn and if catched with paddle will give additional 1 life.
6. if you miss the ball u lose life.
7. break all the bricks in each level to advance to the next level.
8. top score name will be saved and displayed upon game over.
